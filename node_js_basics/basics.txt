Great for tasks that are not CPU intesive
CRUD apps - social networks, chat apps, web apps

Steps to start project:

1) npm init 
    --> this will create a package node.js file as package.js
    --> this file will be used once you move to another computer and execute npm install;  
        to install all dependencies that are needed for the project
        - npm init

2) npm install -D {lib}
    --> will add the installed dependencies to the init package.js file
        - ex. npm isntall uudi
    --> can also have a devDependency, which is a dependency that is only needed
        for during development and does not need to be installed for the app to 
        run
        - EX. npm install -D nodemon
            --> this dependency will allow us not to have to restart the server every time
    --> will also create a package-lock.js that stores all the info needed to download
        all the necessary dependencies

3) nodemon instead of node
    --> lets you see the changes of your page without restarting the 
        server
    --> if nodemon is installed globaly and not just in the project:
        - nodemon {js file without extension}
        EX > nodemon index
    --> if nodemon is installed only in the project:
        1) go to package.js
        2) add a new entry under scripts
            - "{script key}" : "{command}"
            EX > "dev" : "nodemon index"
        3) execute: npm run {script name in scripts}
            EX > npm run dev
